[b]Ultra-Single-Session-2026[/b]
[b]Session Range, Trade Windows, and Alerts[/b]

[b]Overview[/b]
Ultra-Single-Session-2026 marks a single trading session on your chart, tracks that session’s high and low, and helps you watch for breaks when price moves away from the session range. 
It’s made for traders who want accurate session levels across timeframes, optional trade windows, and alerts that don’t fire outside the times they care about.

[b]Session Display[/b]
During the session, the indicator can draw a box to show the session range. It also draws the Session High and Session Low levels. After the session ends, those levels can stay on the chart so you can reference them later.

[b]Sessions[/b]
Choose a preset session (London / New York / Asia / cross sessions) or set your own start and end times. Timezone handling is included so the session stays aligned to the clock you expect.

[b]Customization[/b]
Most visual elements can be adjusted so it fits your chart:
[list]
[*]Colors for box/lines/background
[*]Line style (solid/dotted/dashed) and thickness
[*]Labels (show/hide) and text settings
[*]Box fill options
[*]History options (if enabled)
[/list]

[b]Line Extensions[/b]
You can control how the High/Low lines behave:
[list]
[*]Where the lines begin (from price behavior vs from the session start, depending on your settings)
[*]How far they extend after the session
[*]Optional “frontrun”/projection behavior (if enabled)
[*]Optional history display for prior sessions (if enabled)
[/list]

[b]Trade Windows[/b]
Trade windows are optional time blocks you define. When enabled, the script can mark the window boundaries (and optionally highlight the background) so it’s easy to see when your “allowed trading time” is active.

[b]Alerts[/b]
Alerts trigger from breaks of the Session High or Session Low. You can choose one of these modes:
[list]
[*][b]On Break[/b]: alerts on the first touch/break of the level.
[*][b]Close Out[/b]: alerts only when a candle closes beyond the level.
[*][b]Close In (Sweep)[/b]: alerts when price breaks the level but closes back inside the session range.
[/list]

[b]Trade Window Gating:[/b] If trade window gating is enabled, alerts only fire when the break happens inside your trade window(s).

[b]Higher Timeframe Accuracy[/b]
To keep the session high/low accurate on higher timeframes, the indicator uses 1-minute data for session tracking. This helps prevent missed highs/lows that can happen when a session starts or ends inside a larger candle.

[b]Daily Sessions[/b]
You can also use this for daily session templates (for example midnight-to-midnight, or market open-to-close) to track daily ranges and daily breaks using the same workflow.

[b]Performance Notes[/b]
[list]
[*]More history + more visuals = more drawing objects.
[*]If your chart gets heavy, reduce history depth and/or turn off extra visuals.
